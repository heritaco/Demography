# 01 Concepts and Data

Overview
- This chapter provides an overview of demographic data sources and key concepts used throughout the course. It contains the data dictionary and notes that explain variable definitions and common preprocessing steps.

Learning objectives
- Understand common demographic data formats and variable meanings.
- Be able to export canonical spreadsheets to CSV for reproducible analysis.

Main files
- `data_dictionary.md` — definitions for datasets and variables.
- `02 Person Years.xlsx` — example spreadsheet with person-year calculations (do not edit original binary).

How to view or reproduce
- Required software: PDF viewer for docs, Excel/LibreOffice for `.xlsx`, Python/R for scripts.
- Recommended workflow:
	1. Export required `.xlsx` files to `01 Concepts and Data/data-exports/` as CSV for programmatic use.
	2. Add analysis scripts under `01 Concepts and Data/scripts/` that read from `data-exports/`.

Data handling policy
- Preserve original `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.docx` files. Place any derived CSVs in `01 Concepts and Data/data-exports/` and include a short `README.md` in `scripts/` describing how to run analyses in PowerShell.
